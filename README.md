## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]


Continuous integration is a development practice that requires code to be built and tested multiple times a day, whenever a new feature is commited by a developer. By integrating continuously, teams are able to detect errors quickly and track down bugs more easily. Many development teams find that continuous integration it is crucial to their productivity.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Markus Mühlberger will teach you the concepts of continuous integration. You'll learn how to develop new features for an app using either of two very popular software development workflows, Git Flow and GitHub Flow. You'll also learn how to use both Travis CI and Codeship continuous integration servers and you'll see the differences between them. You'll learn how to continuous delivery from these services to deploy code to Engine Yard Cloud and Heroku. As a bonus, you'll also find out how to set up your own Jenkins CI server and use it to deploy a Rails app to a VPS with Capistrano.
